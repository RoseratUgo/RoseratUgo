### Hi, I'm [Ugo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ugo-roserat/).

I am an apprentice web developer at [EKOD](https://www.ekod.school/), a digital school and in alternation in the company [AC-Concepts](https://www.acr-concept.com/en).

You can find my projects below. I learn and work with javascript frameworks like React, Svelte and Three.js

I'm 20 years old and I know I'm really young but I'm trying to learn from my mistakes by self-taught (yes I'm learning by self-taught even if I'm studying in a school (school doesn't teach me enough ðŸ˜’ ))
